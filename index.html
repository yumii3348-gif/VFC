    <h2>The Challenge of Poverty</h2>
    <p>Poverty remains one of the world’s most urgent problems, trapping millions in cycles of hunger, poor health, and limited opportunity. Many families still struggle to meet basic needs like food, education, and healthcare, and these shortages often pass disadvantage from one generation to the next.</p>
    <p>Its impacts are felt across communities: children may leave school, women often work in insecure low-paid roles, and entire regions suffer slowed development and reduced resilience to crises. Solving poverty is about protecting human dignity and strengthening societies so everyone can thrive.</p>
    <h2>Statistics on Poverty</h2>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Region</th>
        <th>Population Affected</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Global</td>
        <td>319 million people face acute hunger (WFP, 2024)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Philippines</td>
        <td>17.8% poverty incidence (PSA, 2022)</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <h2>What Is Being Done?</h2>
    <p>Governments, NGOs, and communities are combining relief and development measures to fight poverty. Programs such as conditional cash transfers support families while encouraging school attendance and health care, helping children stay in education and families avoid extreme hardship.</p>
    <p>Alongside direct support, efforts focus on expanding healthcare access, creating jobs, and offering skills training and small-business assistance. When short-term aid is paired with opportunities for stable livelihoods, communities gain a better chance to break the cycle for good.</p>
    <h2>Where We Come In</h2>
    <p>Voices for Change is dedicated to raising awareness and empowering students and citizens to take small meaningful actions that contribute to ending poverty.</p>
