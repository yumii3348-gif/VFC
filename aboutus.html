        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>Voices for Change is a community-driven advocacy group born out of compassion and determination during the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. What started in 2020 as a small effort to address the struggles of families living in poverty has grown into a united movement of people who believe in creating opportunities for others.</p>
        <p>Our founder, <strong>Shyra Reign V. Josue</strong>, started this advocacy while she was still a student. Despite her young age, she recognized the urgent need to support families who lacked access to food, healthcare, and education, especially during the pandemic. With courage and determination, she brought people together, turning a small initiative into a growing organization that continues to inspire change.</p>
        <p>Through her leadership, Voices for Change has connected with organizations, volunteers, and changemakers who share the same vision: to fight poverty, promote access to education, and extend healthcare and food security to those who need it most. We are not just an organization — we are a family of volunteers, dreamers, and doers who believe that small acts of kindness, when combined, can create lasting change.</p>
